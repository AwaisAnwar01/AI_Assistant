AI-Assistant
===============================

This project is a personalized assistant that allows users to upload documents, extract their contents, and ask questions based on the uploaded document's content. The assistant leverages natural language processing (NLP) to provide answers to queries about the document, making it a powerful tool for document analysis, summarization, and content extraction.

Features
--------

*   **Document Upload**: Users can upload documents (e.g., PDF, text files) to the platform.
    
*   **Content Extraction**: Automatically extracts text and key information from the uploaded document.
    
*   **Interactive Q&A**: Users can ask questions about the document, and the assistant will provide context-aware answers.
    
*   **Efficient Document Indexing**: Allows easy retrieval of document contents and answers based on user queries.
    
*   **Streamlit Interface**: Simple and interactive user interface for seamless document interaction.

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
    
*   codepip install -r requirements.txt
    

### Running the Application

1.  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.gitcd your-repo-name
    
2.  makefileCopy codeAPI\_KEY=your-api-key-here
    
3.  codestreamlit run streamlitapp.py
    
4.  **Upload a Document**:After running the application, open the browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501. Upload a document in the provided interface.
    
5.  **Ask Questions**:Once the document is uploaded and processed, you can interact with the assistant by asking any question related to the content of the document.
    

### Example Use Case

*   Upload a research paper, and then ask questions like "What is the main objective of the study?" or "Explain the methodology used."
    

Dependencies
------------

*   **Transformers**: Used for natural language processing (Hugging Face models).
    
*   **Streamlit**: For building the user interface.
    
*   **PyPDF2**: For extracting text from PDF documents (if needed).
    
*   **Other Dependencies**: Listed in the requirements.txt.
    

Future Enhancements
-------------------

*   **Multi-format Support**: Enhance support for additional document formats (e.g., DOCX, HTML).
    
*   **Advanced NLP Features**: Implement summarization, keyword extraction, and sentiment analysis for more insightful document analysis.
    
*   **User Authentication**: Secure the app with user login to personalize the experience.
